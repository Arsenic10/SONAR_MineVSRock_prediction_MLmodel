# SONAR_MineVSRock_prediction_MLmodel
This project is a Machine Learning classification model that predicts whether an object detected by sonar signals is a rock or a mine. The dataset used is the Sonar Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository), which contains 60 features representing the strength of sonar signals at different frequencies.
🚀 Project Workflow

Data Loading & Exploration

Imported the Sonar dataset.

Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and class balance.

Data Preprocessing

Encoded categorical labels (R → Rock, M → Mine).

Standardized feature values for better model performance.

Model Training

Implemented a Logistic Regression classifier (baseline model).

Trained the model on the processed dataset.

Evaluation

Measured accuracy on training and test sets.

Evaluated predictions for unseen samples.

📊 Results

Achieved strong classification accuracy for distinguishing rocks and mines.

Model demonstrates the ability of ML to work with real-world sonar signal data.
