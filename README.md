# Rock vs Mine Prediction (Sonar Data Classification)

This project is a **Machine Learning classification model** that predicts whether an object detected by sonar signals is a **rock** or a **mine**.  
The dataset used is the **Sonar Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository)**, which contains 60 features representing the strength of sonar signals at different frequencies.

## 🚀 Project Workflow

### 1. Data Loading & Exploration
- Imported the Sonar dataset.
- Performed exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand feature distributions and class balance.

### 2. Data Preprocessing
- Encoded categorical labels (`R` → Rock, `M` → Mine).
- Standardized feature values for better model performance.

### 3. Model Training
- Implemented a **Logistic Regression classifier** (baseline model).
- Trained the model on the processed dataset.

### 4. Evaluation
- Measured accuracy on training and test sets.
- Evaluated predictions for unseen samples.
