# SONAR_MineVSRock_prediction_MLmodel
This project is a Machine Learning classification model that predicts whether an object detected by sonar signals is a rock or a mine. The dataset used is the Sonar Dataset (UCI Machine Learning Repository), which contains 60 features representing the strength of sonar signals at different frequencies.
